  weeklyReport: `Big week for hydration — you hit **Drink 2L of water** every single day, which is a real anchor habit forming.

Your **morning runs** slipped to 3/5 on weekdays — you're strongest Mon–Wed and tend to lose momentum mid-week. Reading and side-project work both held steady around 5/7 days.

One pattern worth noting: weekend completions across the board dropped about 30%. That's normal, but if you want to keep the streaks alive, try setting one tiny weekend version of each habit (a 5-minute walk instead of a full run, for example).

Overall this was a strong week. The fact that water is now automatic frees up willpower to focus on the trickier ones. Proud of you — keep going.`,
  recovery: `You had a great run with **Morning run** — 14 days at one point. Broken streaks are part of the journey, not the end of it.

**Day 1:** No pressure. Lace up your shoes and do a 10-minute walk-jog. The goal isn't pace, it's just showing up.

**Day 2:** 20 minutes at an easy pace. Pick a route you actually like.

**Day 3:** Back to your usual 30-minute run. By now the inertia has flipped.

Most streaks don't break because of motivation — they break because of friction. Try laying out your shoes the night before. Small setup, big payoff.`,
  morning: `Good morning, Alex! You're sitting on a **12-day water streak** — keep that going, it's the easiest win of your day. 💧 One small nudge: your **journal** habit needs a few minutes today to keep momentum. You've got this.`,
